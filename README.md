## Trellobo
This is a simple IRC bot written using [cinch](http://github.com/cinchrb/cinch). The idea is that people using the *dublinjs* IRC channel can address the bot to get a list of the current ideas for talks that are stored as cards in a Trello board. 

## Implementation Notes

The bot is online and will respond in a stupid fashion if address directly. I've to suss out the Trello API before
it can do anything useful.
