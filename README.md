## Trellobo
This is a simple IRC bot written using [cinch](http://github.com/cinchrb/cinch). The idea is that people using the *dublinjs* IRC channel can address the bot to get a list of the current ideas for talks that are stored as cards in a Trello board. 
## Implementation Notes

Use *trellobot: ideas* to get a list of the cards in the Ideas list on the Dublin JS Trello board.
